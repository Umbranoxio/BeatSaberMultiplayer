# BeatSaberMultiplayer

The beat saber multiplayer plugin is in it's extreme beta phase, most bugs have been squashed, but some definitely still do exist.

Things you should know before using the beta:

* When creating a room, there is a 1 in 10 chance your game will crash
* If the host switches songs while a user is trying to download a song, the users song won't update
* The host currently has no way to tell if everybody is ready, get creative, the beta testers simply put their hands in the air if they are ready

This will be open sourced after the beta test, check "releases" for the latest release
