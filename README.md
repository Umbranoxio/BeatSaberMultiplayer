# BeatSaberMultiplayer

The beat saber multiplayer plugin is in it's extreme beta phase, most bugs have been squashed, but some definitely still do exist.

## Notice

The multiplayer plugin has been disabled until further notice, as I will now be implementing the feature directly into Beat Saber itself (https://twitter.com/BeatSaber/status/1011267998487908353)

Although, keep an eye on this page, as the plugin may be used in the future for potential early closed beta testing

## Features

* Any user can create a room (password optional) and become a room host
* Hosts can switch songs, this gets synchronized with the users
* Hosts can force start a song, all users will begin playing
* Once in a song, everyone in the room will see a live leaderboard with everyones scores
* **All users in a room will have a player avatar which everyone else can see, just like VRChat**

## Things you should know before using the beta

* When creating a room, there is a 1 in 10 chance your game will crash
* If the host switches songs while a user is trying to download a song, the users song won't update
* The host currently has no way to tell if everybody is ready, get creative, the beta testers simply put their hands in the air if they are ready
* If a user disconnects from a room ungracefully, rarely the server may not despawn them from the room

This will be open sourced after the beta test, check "releases" for the latest release
